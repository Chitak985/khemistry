// These settings can be edited by the user in order to enable support for other mods.
// Mods that only have one version supported will not be here, however if Khemistry
// supports multiple version, you will need to pick one in order for the mod to add support for it.

// Use None when you don't want to enable support for the mod or your version doesn't match.
// Enter mod version without dots and remove any zeros at the front, for example 0.9.3 would be 93. (or just use the things in parentheses)
// Some mod versions are supported automatically and you do not need to specify the version.
