// These settings can be edited by the user in order to enable support for other mods.
// Mods that only have one version supported will not be here, however if Khemistry

// Use None when you don't want to enable support for the mod or your version doesn't match.
// Enter mod version without dots, for example 1.2.1 would be 121. (or just use the things in parentheses)
