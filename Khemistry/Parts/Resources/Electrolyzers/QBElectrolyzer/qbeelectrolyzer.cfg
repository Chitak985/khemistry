	description = Probodobodyne was supposed to specialize in probes, but when the engineers accidentally fried their QBE probe by pouring water on it and later found molecules of hydrogen around their work place, QBEElectrolyzer was born. This QBE has been completely hollowed out and replaced with a maching capable of electrolyzing various materials in small amounts.
