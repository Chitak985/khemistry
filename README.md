This mod adds chemistry to KSP by adding every single compound, element, and all chemical (and not very chemical) resources to the game! <br>

<h2>Dependencies:</h2>
<strong>ModuleManager</strong> <br>
<strong>Kopernicus</strong> (adds custom ores for all planets, mod may break without it) <br>
<strong>B9 Part Switch</strong> (assigns the custom per planet ores for cargo tanks, mod may break without it) <br>

<h2>Recommended Mods:</h2>
<strong>SpaceDust</strong> (include to add resource belts) <br>

<h2>Fully Supported Mods:</h2>
<strong>Station Parts Expansion Redux</strong> (cargo parts can hold some planet-speciifc resources) <br>
<strong>Far Future Technologies</strong> (WARNING: Very broken! changes resources used and some recipes) <br>
<strong>Near Future Propulsion</strong> (engines, tanks, and rcs use khemistry resources) <br>
<strong>All Kopernicus Planet Packs</strong> (Custom ores and pressurized air are added per planet and the stock ore is removed)

<h2>Supported mods:</h2>
<strong>Real Solar System</strong> (vast resource definitions) <br>
<strong>Community Resource Pack</strong> (removes all resources for now) <br>
<strong>Near Future Electrical</strong> (support for all parts added by the mod, may have problems) <br>

<h2>Incompatible mods:</h2>
None found for now but some will be either added to here or they will get supported. <br>

<h2>Fully Supported Mods Without Support:</h2>
These mods are confirmed to work flawlessly with Khemistry and need no patches to be compatible. <br>
<strong>Near Future Construction</strong> (some of its patches may need support) <br>
<strong>Heat Control</strong> <br>
<strong>Near Future Solar</strong> <br>
<strong>Radioactivity</strong> <br>
<strong>Deployable Engines</strong> <br>
