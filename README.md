This mod adds chemistry to KSP by adding every single compound, element, and all chemical (and not very chemical) resources to the game! <br>

<h2>Dependencies:</h2>

<strong>SpaceDust</strong> (include to add atmospheric and cosmic resources) <br>

<h2>Fully Supported Mods:</h2>
<strong>Station Parts Expansion Redux</strong> (cargo parts can hold some planet-speciifc resources) <br>
<strong>Outer Planets Mod</strong> (all planets have their own regolith types) <br>
<strong>Far Future Technologies</strong> (WARNING: Very broken! changes resources used and some recipes) <br>
<strong>Near Future Propulsion</strong> (engines, tanks, and rcs use khemistry resources) <br>

<h2>Supported mods:</h2>
<strong>Real Solar System</strong> (different and better resources) <br>
